## 📥 Load Dataset

india_road <- read.csv("C:/Users/HP/Desktop/Q1/T1/Prob and stats/Project/Road.csv")

## 📊 Descriptive Statistics

```{r}
summary(india_road)
describe(india_road[, 1:ncol(india_road)])
#Most variables are categorical (e.g., age band, vehicle type, light conditions).
#Mean casualties ≈ 1.55, with up to 8 casualties in a single accident.
#Distribution skew:
#Sex_of_driver: skewed heavily toward one category (likely male).Road_allignment, Road_surface_type, and Weather_conditions: show extreme skewness and kurtosis, indicating very uneven category distributions like most accidents might occur on straight roads or in clear weather)
```

## 📈 Bar Plot: Accidents by Day

```{r}
accident_counts <- table(india_road$Day_of_week)
barplot(accident_counts,
        main = "Accidents by Day of the Week",
        xlab = "Day",
        ylab = "Number of Accidents",
        col = "skyblue", las = 2)
```

## 🥧 Pie Chart: Accident Severity Distribution

```{r}
pie(table(india_road$Accident_severity), 
    main = "Accident Severity", 
    col = rainbow(length(unique(india_road$Accident_severity))))
#Majority of accidents are Slight Injuries.Fatal Injuries are a small fraction. This indicates that while accidents are common, they’re not always severe

```

## 📅 Weekend Analysis

```{r}
weekend_days <- c("Saturday", "Sunday")
india_road$Weekend <- india_road$Day_of_week %in% weekend_days

# Probability of accident on weekend
mean(india_road$Weekend)
#25.4% of all accidents occur on weekends.While lower than 50%, still significant.
```

## 📊 Conditional Probability: Severity by Day

```{r}
prop.table(table(india_road$Accident_severity, india_road$Day_of_week), 2)
#Fatal injuries spike on Saturday (2.2%) and Sunday (2.4%).Slight injuries dominate every day but proportionally decrease on weekends
```

## 🔍 t-test: Weekday vs Weekend Accidents

```{r}
day_counts <- table(india_road$Day_of_week)
week_status <- names(day_counts) %in% weekend_days
t.test(day_counts[week_status], day_counts[!week_status])
#p-value = 0.16 → not statistically significant.Means: Weekend avg = 1566.5; Weekday avg = 1836.6.No strong evidence that accident count differs between weekdays and weekends
# p is high so NULL will fly

```

## 🔁 Chi-square Test: Severity vs Day

```{r}
chisq.test(table(india_road$Accident_severity, india_road$Day_of_week))
#Chi-sq = 47.20, p < 0.001.Strong association between day of week and accident severity.Supports earlier probability analysis on severity variation by day

```

## 🔬 ANOVA: Severity Across Time Period

```{r}
india_road$Hour <- as.numeric(substr(india_road$Time, 1, 2))
india_road$Severity_numeric <- as.numeric(factor(india_road$Accident_severity))
india_road$TimePeriod <- cut(india_road$Hour,
                             breaks = c(-1, 6, 12, 18, 24),
                             labels = c("Night", "Morning", "Afternoon", "Evening"))
anova_result <- aov(Severity_numeric ~ TimePeriod, data = india_road)
summary(anova_result)
#p < 0.001, F = 14.98.Severity levels significantly differ by time periods (Morning, Afternoon, Night).
```

## 🧪 Kruskal-Wallis: Severity by Day (Non-parametric)

```{r}
kruskal.test(Severity_numeric ~ Day_of_week, data = india_road)
#p = 0.0404.Confirms that accident severity varies by day even when normality is not assumed.
```

## 🔗 Correlation Matrix

```{r}
india_road$Day_numeric <- as.numeric(factor(india_road$Day_of_week, 
                                            levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")))

numeric_data <- india_road %>% 
  mutate(Sex_numeric = as.numeric(factor(Sex_of_driver)),
         Edu_numeric = as.numeric(factor(Educational_level)),
         Exp_numeric = as.numeric(factor(Driving_experience)),
         Light_numeric = as.numeric(factor(Light_conditions)),
         Weather_numeric = as.numeric(factor(Weather_conditions)),
         Cause_numeric = as.numeric(factor(Cause_of_accident)),
         Area_numeric = as.numeric(factor(Area_accident_occured)),
         Align_numeric = as.numeric(factor(Road_allignment))) %>%
  select_if(is.numeric)

cor_matrix <- cor(numeric_data, use = "complete.obs")
round(cor_matrix, 2)
#Severity correlates weakly with all variables.no single variable strongly drives severity on its own

```

## 📦 Boxplot: Severity by Time Period

```{r}
ggplot(india_road, aes(x = TimePeriod, y = Severity_numeric)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "orange", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Accident Severity by Time of Day", x = "Time Period", y = "Severity (numeric)")
#Outliers in Nighttime suggest some very severe accidents.Median severity is higher in Evening and Night.
```

## 🔍 Logistic Regression: Predict Severe Accidents

```{r}
# Create numeric columns directly in india_road
india_road$Sex_numeric <- as.numeric(factor(india_road$Sex_of_driver))
india_road$Edu_numeric <- as.numeric(factor(india_road$Educational_level))
india_road$Exp_numeric <- as.numeric(factor(india_road$Driving_experience))
india_road$Light_numeric <- as.numeric(factor(india_road$Light_conditions))
india_road$Weather_numeric <- as.numeric(factor(india_road$Weather_conditions))
india_road$Area_numeric <- as.numeric(factor(india_road$Area_accident_occured))

india_road$Severe <- ifelse(india_road$Accident_severity == "Fatal injury", 1, 0)
logit_model <- glm(Severe ~ Day_numeric + Hour + Sex_numeric + Edu_numeric +
                     Exp_numeric + Light_numeric + Weather_numeric + Area_numeric, 
                   data = india_road, family = binomial)
summary(logit_model)
#Significant Predictors are Day_Numeric and Hour as they have very low p value and they have a higher chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.Personal/driver factors don’t significantly affect fatal injury likelihood.
```

## 🕓 Specific Hours Analysis

```{r}
hours_to_check <- c("0:04:00", "0:10:00", "0:18:00", "0:36:00", "0:56:00", 
                    "1:12:00", "1:35:00", "10:01:00", "11:06:00", "11:08:00", 
                    "11:16:00", "11:44:00", "12:04:00", "12:11:00", "12:14:00")

india_road$Time_stripped <- substr(india_road$Time, 2, 8)
subset_times <- india_road[india_road$Time_stripped %in% hours_to_check, ]
table(subset_times$Accident_severity)
#At low p-value time slots:2 Fatal, 21 Serious, 81 Slight Accidents.These windows are crucial for real-time intervention like patrols, cameras.
```

## 📊 Bar Plot: Severity at Specific Times

```{r}
barplot(table(subset_times$Accident_severity), 
        main = "Severity at Low p-value Times", 
        col = "tomato", ylab = "Count")
#visualization confirms most cases at critical hours are Slight.the presence of Fatal and Serious suggests the need for alert systems even during low-volume windows.
